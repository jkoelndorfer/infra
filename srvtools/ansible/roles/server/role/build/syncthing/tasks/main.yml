# We use these to support our backup script.
#
# duplicity, of course, handles most of the backup work.
#
# xmllint can find the API key of syncthing:
#
# $ xmllint config.xml --xpath "configuration/gui/apikey.text()"
#
# jq is used to help interact with the syncthing API.
# See specifically:
#   https://docs.syncthing.net/rest/db-status-get.html
#   https://docs.syncthing.net/rest/system-config-get.html.
